# 💻 Flipkart Laptop Reviews – Data Analysis Project
---
## 📖 About
This project explores customer laptop reviews from Flipkart using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to identify patterns in customer feedback and understand what influences positive or negative review scores. It combines technical EDA with business decision-making theory from the DSS domain, helping translate real-world data into actionable insights.

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository presents a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Flipkart laptop reviews dataset.  
The work focuses on:
- Cleaning and analysing review data
- Visualising customer sentiment trends
- Linking findings to business-focused Decision Support Systems (DSS)

All analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, and the final results were interpreted through visual plots.
